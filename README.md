# Pokemon App

The app shows a list of the pokemons seen by the user. Once the user has seen a pokemon, it can be caught or not by clicking the pokemon ball.
The user can filter the pokemons to be displayed: All, only caught pokemons or only uncaught pokemons.

The Pokemon data is retrieved from the public api PokeAPI `https://pokeapi.co/`.

## Stack used

## Additional notes

The table to store the data won't be created programmatically. Therefore, it should be created using pgAdmin or any similar tool.
The app has not been deployed. You have to run the app (backend and frontend) locally.
